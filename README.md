# Pole-Zero Map GUI

This code provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for manipulating poles and zeros in a pole-zero map, allowing you to observe their impact on the Bode plot.

### Constants:
- `drawArea`: 10
- `GAIN`: 100
- `nDoublePole`: 1
- `nDoubleZero`: 1
- `nSinglePole`: 1
- `nSingleZero`: 1

You can customize the number of poles or zeros to interact with. The `drawArea` parameter defines the "sandbox" of the map. Placing a pole or zero inside this sandbox affects the transfer function and consequently alters the Bode plot.

The `GAIN` constant acts as a multiplier for the transfer function.

Enjoy experimenting with the GUI! :)
